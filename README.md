DATA ANALYST 


As a data analyst I am a self learner an autodidact by nature with passion for numbers,
excellent communication skills and a quest for growth and exploration of new frontiers.

I bring to the field of data analysis from my therapeutic experience the qualities of
accurate assessment and a deep understanding of human behavior.
