DATA ANALYST 


As a data analyst I bring to the field of data analysis from my therapeutic experience the
qualities of accurate assessment and a deep understanding of human behavior.

I am an autodidact by nature with passion to numbers, excellent learning skills and a
quest for growth and exploration of new frontiers.
